1. Participant Flow Diagram
  Depicts the progression of participants through each stage of the study (enrollment, intervention allocation, follow-up, and analysis).
2. Baseline Characteristics Plot
  Compares demographic and baseline characteristics of participants between treatment groups.
3. Efficacy Results Plots
  Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves: Illustrate time-to-event data, such as overall survival or progression-free survival.
  Forest Plots: Show the effect size and confidence intervals for primary and secondary endpoints, often used in meta-analyses.
4. Adverse Event Plots
  Bar Charts: Display the frequency and severity of adverse events in each treatment group.
  Waterfall Plots: Show individual patient responses, such as changes in tumor size.
5. Laboratory Results Plots
  Box Plots: Represent the distribution of lab results (e.g., blood tests) between treatment groups.
  Line Plots: Track changes in lab results over time for each treatment group.
6. Pharmacokinetics (PK) Plots
  Concentration-Time Curves: Show the concentration of the drug in the blood over time.
  Dose-Response Curves: Illustrate the relationship between the drug dose and its pharmacological effect.
7. Vital Signs and Other Continuous Measures
  Line Plots: Track changes in vital signs (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate) over time.
  Scatter Plots: Explore relationships between different continuous variables.
8. Quality of Life and Patient-Reported Outcomes
  Spider/Radar Charts: Visualize multiple dimensions of patient-reported outcomes.
  Line Plots: Track changes in quality of life scores over time.
9. Subgroup Analysis Plots
  Forest Plots: Display the treatment effect within predefined subgroups (e.g., age, gender, disease severity).
10. Compliance and Exposure Plots
  Histograms or Bar Charts: Show the distribution of drug exposure (e.g., dosage, duration) among participants.
  Line Plots: Track individual compliance over time.
