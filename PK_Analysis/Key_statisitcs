Cmax (Maximum Concentration):
The highest concentration of the drug in the blood plasma after administration.
Indicates the peak level of drug exposure.

Tmax (Time to Maximum Concentration):
The time it takes to reach Cmax.
Provides information about the rate of absorption.

AUC (Area Under the Curve):
The integral of the concentration-time curve (usually from time zero to the last measurable concentration or infinity).
Represents the total drug exposure over time.
Commonly used methods to calculate AUC include the trapezoidal rule.

t1/2 (Half-life):
The time required for the plasma concentration of a drug to reduce by half.
Indicates how quickly a drug is eliminated from the body.

CL (Clearance):
The volume of plasma from which the drug is completely removed per unit time.
Reflects the efficiency of drug elimination processes.

Vd (Volume of Distribution:
A hypothetical volume that represents the distribution of the drug throughout the body.
Provides insight into how extensively a drug disperses into body tissues.

MRT (Mean Residence Time):
The average time a drug molecule stays in the body.
Calculated as the area under the first moment curve (AUMC) divided by AUC.


Bioavailability (F):
The fraction of an administered dose that reaches systemic circulation in an active form.
Essential for comparing different drug formulations or routes of administration.


Cmin (Minimum Concentration):
The lowest concentration of the drug in the blood plasma during a dosing interval at steady state.
Important for maintaining therapeutic levels without dropping below the effective concentration.

Ke (Elimination Rate Constant):
The rate at which a drug is removed from the body.
Related to half-life and clearance.

Lag Time (Tlag):
The time delay between drug administration and the first measurable concentration in the blood plasma.
Indicates the onset of absorption.

Fluctuation:
The difference between Cmax and Cmin within one dosing interval.
Important for understanding the variability in drug concentrations.
